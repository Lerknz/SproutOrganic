This includes a header with a navigation menu linking to each section, a main section with each of the four sections from your code, and a footer with a thank you message. Note that I added an ID attribute to each section so that they can be linked to from the navigation menu. Additionally, you may want to add images, styling, and other content to make the website more visually appealing and informative.
